      <h3>Life Story</h3>
      <div class="background">
        <p>I grew up in the panhandle of Florida near Eglin Air Force Base and the beautiful white beaches of the Emerald Coast. For college, I moved to Orlando and attended the University of Central Florida, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's in International Relations. To this day, politics, especially foreign policy, continue to be something I am interested in.
        </p>
        <p>At Central Florida, I was given a 4-year Army ROTC scholarship. I comissioned into the Army Reserves on May 7, 2011, as an Engineer officer. At the end of 2011, I volunteered for a deployment to Afghanistan with a combat engineer company. From 2012-2013, I led a platoon of 30 Soldiers, clearing roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan. I was proud to work primarily with the British army there, one of the most professional yet amicable organizations I've ever had the pleasure of supporting.
        </p>
        <p>Today, I live in the Washington, D.C. area. After working a variety of operations and management positions, I decided to try and take a small hobby of coding and passion with computers, and turn it into a career through General Assmebly's Web Development Immersive program. When I'm not trying to learn how to make sense of JavaScript, you can find me at one of a million sports bars in the DC area, supporting any number of hapless Florida teams.
